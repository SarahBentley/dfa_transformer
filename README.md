# Simulating DFAs
This repository contains code for my experiments on simulating deterministic finite automata (DFAs) using a bilinear model and various transformer architectures. The bilinear model and training script can be found in the `/src/bilinear` directory. The DFA class and corresponding OneHotEncoders can be found in the `/src/DFA` directory. The transformer models, including GT, WGT, and RWGT, as well as their training scripts can be found in the `/src/GT` directory.
